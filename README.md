# Discord-image-downloader-and-uploader


These are 2 simple python scripts that will ONLY WORK IN A DISCORD SERVER

What this does is download every image in a discord server's channel

You need to change these 3 varibles: TOKEN, CHANNEL_ID, and DOWNLOAD_FOLDER

Yes you do need to use a bot for this to work that's what the TOKEN varible is for.

^^This link will send you to the discord develop portal where you can develop bots^^

For these scirpts to work your bot needs to have the correct permissons

First make an application and name it whatever you want

Go to OAuth2 and under 'OAuth2 URL Generator' **_ONLY_** select bot and then scroll down to get the invite link.

Paste it in your sever of interest and invite the bot

Then go to the Bot tab and make sure all the Privileged Gateway Intents options are selected.

-------

Now that the bot is invited open the scirpts in VS code (this way if there is an issue you know exactly what went wrong)

And then press F5 --> python file and then watch the terminal in VS code and watch the magic. 

If there are any issues let me know!
